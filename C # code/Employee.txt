Question:
(Employee Class) Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as
either instance variables or automatic properties—a first name (type string), a last name (type
string) and a monthly salary (decimal). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the
three values. Provide a property with a get and set accessor for any instance variables. If the monthly
salary is negative, the set accessor should leave the instance variable unchanged. Write a test app
named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects
and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s
yearly salary again.

Solution:

 public class EmployeeTest
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.Write("Please enter your first name: ");
            string firstname = Console.ReadLine();
            Console.Write("Please enter your last name: ");
            string lastname = Console.ReadLine();
            Console.Write("Please enter your monthly salary: ");
            decimal monthlysalary = Convert.ToDecimal(Console.ReadLine());

            Employee Employee1= new Employee(firstname,lastname,monthlysalary);
            Console.WriteLine("Employee: {0} {1} \nAnnual Salary: {2:c}",Employee1.FirstName,Employee1.LastName,Employee1.Salary);
            Console.WriteLine("Annual salary after 10% raise: {0:c}", Employee1.RaiseSalary());
        }
        
    }

        public Employee(string fname,string lname,decimal salry)

            FirstName = fname;
            LastName = lname;
            Salary = salry;

            }
        }

        public string LastName
