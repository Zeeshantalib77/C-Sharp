(Find the Largest Number) The process of finding the maximum value (i.e., the largest of
a group of values) is used frequently in computer applications. For example, an app that determines
the winner of a sales contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson
who sells the most units wins the contest. Write pseudocode, then a C# app that inputs a
series of 10 integers, then determines and displays the largest integer. Your app should use at least
the following three variables:
a) counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been
input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).
b) number: The integer most recently input by the user.
c) largest: The largest number found so far.

 class LargestNumberTest
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            LargestNumber number = new LargestNumber();
            number.Comparison();
        }
    }
    class LargestNumber
    {
        public void Comparison()
        {
           int  counter = 0;
            double Largest= 0;
           double number;
            
            while (counter < 10) 
            {
                Console.Write("Please enter the number: ");
                number = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
                if (number>Largest)
                {
                    Largest = number;
                }
                Console.WriteLine("Largest number= {0}", Largest);
                Console.WriteLine("Last number inputed is {0}", number);
                counter++;
            }
            
        }
